# Arduino Oscilloscope

This project is going to implement a simple oscilloscope using an Arduino Mega 2560. The oscilloscope samples up to 8 ADC channels and streams the data to a PC for visualization.

## Features \[wip\]

- Timed sampling of up to 8 channels on the ADC
- Configurable sampling frequency
- Continuous sampling mode
- Buffered sampling mode with trigger conditions
- Asynchronous serial communication using UART interrupts
